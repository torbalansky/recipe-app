                <strong>About me:</strong> I began my career as a biochemist but have since transitioned into the field of web development ðŸ§ªðŸš€. 
                My primary focus revolves around creating user-friendly web applications that cater to a diverse audience.
                When I'm not immersed in coding, you can often find me enjoying music, exploring the beauty of the great outdoors, or engaging in sports activities.
                This recipe app is one of my educational projects, where I've refined my web development skills. </h6>
